# How to add or change content

**Easiest way: the web editor.** With the server running, open **http://localhost:3000/editor** in a browser. You get clickable forms for Classes, Monsters, Items & Shop, Skills, Dungeons, Loot & Drop Rates, Combat, Starting values, Anomalies and Story text — no terminal needed. Changes apply to `content.js` when you press **Save to content.js** (each save makes a backup first). Restart the server (`npm start`) afterwards.

Two other ways to edit:

- **Terminal editor:** run `npm run edit` for guided menus (same content, older interface).
- **By hand:** open `content.js` directly. Everything below documents the fields.

**Where is the editor allowed?** On your own computer (`localhost`) it is always open. On the published site it is **locked** so nobody else can tamper with the game. To enable it remotely, set a password on the server:

```
set CONTENT_EDIT_TOKEN=YourPassword
npm start
```

then visit `https://your-game.onrender.com/editor?token=YourPassword`.

Drag picture files into `public/images/...`. If a file is missing, the game still runs with a colored fallback.

Drag picture files into `public/images/...`. If a file is missing, the game still runs with a colored fallback.

## Change a class (HP, attack, mana, resistance, magic power)

Open `content.js` → `classes`. Find the class (`warrior`, `mage`, …). The setup screen shows the **8 base classes**: Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Rogue, Paladin, Assassin, Tank, Support Mage — each of which evolves into stronger forms at levels 20 and 40 (see the Class evolution section). The `content.js` roster also contains those evolved classes (marked with `baseClass`), which never appear on the setup screen.

- `hp.min` / `hp.max` — rolled once at character create (level 1). Tank example: 650–750.
- Same for `attack`, `mana`, `resistance`, `magicPower`, `healPower`.
- `healPower` — boosts **ally-targeted skill healing only** (food, potions, and lifesteal are unaffected). Formula: `multiplier = 1 + healPower / 40`. So `10` → +25% healing, `20` → +50%. Support classes (Paladin, Support Mage) start around 8–15.
- `growth` — added **each time they level up** (not on create).
- `speed` — used later in combat (fastest players act first).
- `image` — path after you drop a PNG, e.g. `public/images/characters/tank.png`.

## Add a new class (easy way)

Run `npm run edit` → **Classes** → **Add new…** (or in the web editor: **Classes** → **Add**, pick an existing class to copy from), then edit its fields. It appears on the setup screen automatically once you restart.

Or add a class by hand:

1. Copy an existing class object in `classes`.
2. Change `slug` (lowercase, no spaces), `label`, ranges, `growth`, `image`, `basicAttack`, `startingSkills`.
3. Drop art at `public/images/characters/<slug>.png`.
4. Restart. It appears on the setup screen automatically.

## Change starting gold, wood, lives, stamina

`starting` at the top of `content.js`.

## XP and max level

`leveling`:

- `maxLevel` (default 50)
- `xpBase` (default 500) — XP from level 1 → 2 is exactly this when exponent math is `500 * 1^exp`
- `xpExponent` (default 1.45) — higher = steeper curve at high levels

Formula used by the server:

`xp needed to go from level L to L+1` = `round(xpBase * L ^ xpExponent)`

Most XP will come from dungeon clears later. You can set `town.search.xp` if you want Search to grant a little XP now (default 0).

## Anomalies (traits)

`anomalies.anomalyChance` — chance of a **normal** trait (default `0.06` = 6%).  
`anomalies.pureBloodChance` — chance of a **pure-blood** trait (default `0.02` = 2%).

Examples: `0.04` and `0.005` for 4% / 0.5%.

Roll order: pure-blood first, else normal, else none.

To add a trait, push an object onto `anomalies.traits`:

- `id` — unique, lowercase
- `name`, `description`
- `pureBlood` — `true` only for the rare version
- `rarity` — `uncommon` | `rare` | `pureblood` (or your own label)
- `frameColor` — portrait border, e.g. `"#c45c6a"`
- `effect` — stored on the character; combat will use it later (`lifesteal`, etc.)

Sanguine Thirst (`lifesteal` 10%) and Primeval Bloodlust (`lifesteal` 20%) are already listed.

## Town costs and Search loot

`town.search.stamina` and `outcomes` (gold/wood ranges, `food` range, text, `weight`). An outcome with `food: [1, 2]` grants 1–2 food when you hit it. **Search never costs HP** — the combat health bar belongs to dungeon fights only; your real lives are the hearts.

`town.blacksmith` — just `stamina` (how many shops can visit in a day).  
`town.tavern.bets` — allowed gold bets.  
`town.tavern.provisions` — `foodPrice` (gold) and `foodAmount` for buying Field Rations at the Tavern.  
`town.rest.stamina` — stamina gained by pressing **Rest** (default `6`), capped at your max. Pressing Rest doesn't end your day — it's for waiting players to top up while others dawdle.

## Sleep vs Rest

To pass the day in multiplayer, **everyone presses Sleep** (it ends your day — stamina drops to 0 and returns at dawn). If someone is slow, waiting players can press **Rest** any number of times to gain `town.rest.stamina` stamina (capped at max) and keep doing town actions. Once you've pressed Sleep you can no longer Rest or act, until the day turns.

## Dungeons

`dungeons` array: `rank`, `label`, `image`, `stamina`, `xpReward` (for later combat), `goldScale` / `woodScale`, `loot` percents (Legendary / Epic / Mythic / Remnant). F-rank stays the weakest.

Add a rank by copying a row and dropping art in `public/images/dungeons/`.

## Skills and the 6-slot combat bar

Every character fights with a **3-column × 2-row grid of 6 skill slots** in combat:

- **Slot 1** is always the class **basic attack** (free, no mana, targets an enemy). It's set per class: `basicAttack: { id: "slash", name: "Slash", power: 1.0, image: "/images/skills/slash.png", description: "Deals 1× attack damage." }`. Change it to give a class a different signature move.
- **Slots 2–6** are the class's unlocked skills (`startingSkills` — a list of skill **ids**, up to 5). Every class starts with **2** — so the whole bar is **basic attack + 2 skills = 3 filled slots**, and 3 empty placeholders. A player with no skills sees empty placeholder slots only.
- **Hover a filled slot in battle** to see a tooltip with its name, what it does, and its scale (e.g. "Deals 1.6× attack damage." or "Deals 2× attack damage and heals for half the damage dealt."). That text comes from each skill's `description`.

**Each skill can be used once per turn** — including the basic attack. After you use it, the slot greys out until that character's turn comes around again (the used state resets when your next turn starts).

A class example (each class has its own starting skills):

```js
{
  slug: "warrior",
  label: "Warrior",
  basicAttack: { id: "slash", name: "Slash", power: 1.0, image: "/images/skills/slash.png", description: "Deals 1× attack damage." },
  startingSkills: ["heavy_strike", "defend"],
  ...
}
```

A skill row in the `skills` array has:

- `id`, `name`, `image`, `description` (shown in the hover tooltip)
- `target` — `enemy` (pick a monster), `ally` (pick a teammate, yourself included), `self` (no target pick), or `party` (every living member, yourself included — no target pick)
- `mana` — cost to use
- `power` — damage multiplier: `attack × power` (with a ±`combat.damageVariance` roll)
- `lifesteal` — optional; heals you for this fraction of the damage dealt (e.g. `0.5` = heal half the damage). Combined with `power` for "deals 2× and heals half".
- `healSelfPct` — for `enemy`-target skills that heal the **caster**: fraction of your own `maxHp` restored when the skill lands (e.g. `0.4` = 40%). No target pick for yourself.
- `heal` — fraction of the target's `maxHp` restored (e.g. `0.35` = 35%). With `target: "party"` this heals **every** living member.
- `manaRestore` / `manaRestorePct` — optional mana refunded to the caster (flat, or a fraction of max mana). With `target: "party"` it restores **every** living member, capped at their max. Example: `spirit_surge` restores 30% of each ally's max mana.
- `defense` — fraction of incoming monster damage blocked for the round (e.g. `0.5` = 50%)
- `element` — optional damage type that changes the hit animation, damage-number color, sound, and VFX. Built-in choices: `physical`, `arcane`, `shadow`, `holy`, `frost`, `fire`, `water`, `earth`, `nature`, `lightning`, `blood`, `dark`. The full pick list (for skills, monsters, and pets) is driven by the **Elements** page, so any element you add there immediately becomes selectable. Class basic attacks and monsters can also carry `element`.

Add a new skill by pushing a row onto `skills` (give it a `description`), then adding its `id` to a class's `startingSkills`.

### Elements (damage types)

Elements live in the `elements` array (editable in the **Elements** page of `/editor`). Each entry:

- `id` — the internal id used by skills, monsters and pets (e.g. `nature`)
- `name` — display name
- `palette` — comma-separated hex colors; used for particles and UI tints
- `gravity` — VFX particle gravity (negative values rise, e.g. fire)
- `sound` — hit sound (picked from the sounds folder)
- `effect` / `travel` — the VFX id used for a hit / a flying projectile. Optional: if left empty, the game auto-generates a colored effect (`element_<id>` burst and `element_<id>_projectile` projectile) from the element's palette, so new elements work even without a custom VFX.
- `description` — for your own reference

Adding a brand-new element is only a matter of adding a row here (plus optionally a custom VFX entry in `public/effects.js`); the editor, combat, sounds, and visuals pick it up automatically.

Add a new skill by pushing a row onto `skills` (give it a `description`), then adding its `id` to a class's `startingSkills`.

## The Skill Tree

The Skill Tree (`content.js` → `skillTree`) is how players spend the skill points they earn (they start with `startingPoints`, and every level up grants `pointsPerLevel` more). The panel in town shows a **Global** tab (skills any class may learn) and a tab for the player's own **class lineage** (their base class plus every evolved form in the chain). The tree is a zoomable, pannable map; nodes auto-layout by prereq tier, so you never have to position them.

The tree data:

```js
skillTree: {
  pointsPerLevel: 3,
  startingPoints: 3,
  maxLoadout: 5,
  global: [ /* 30 shared nodes */ ],
  lineages: {
    warrior:   [ /* base + warlord + war_emperor nodes */ ],
    ranger:    [ /* ... */ ],
    ...        // one key per base class (warrior, ranger, mage, rogue, paladin, assassin, support, tank, tamer)
  },
}
```

A skill node looks like:

```js
{
  skill: "heavy_strike",          // id from the `skills` array
  prereq: "cleave",               // skill id you must already own to learn this (omit for no requirement)
  minLevel: 12,                   // optional level gate (use 20/40 to gate evolution skills)
  cost: 1,                        // skill points to spend (default 1 if omitted)
  owned: true,                    // optional: true = granted automatically at creation (base-class skills)
}
```

Rules:

- **Prereqs:** a node can't be learned until you own `prereq`. The layout builds chains from this — no positions needed.
- **Availability:** nodes with `ownerClass` are restricted to that class (evolution signature skills are gated like this). Global nodes ignore the field.
- **Gates:** if a node has `minLevel`, you must be that level. Use `minLevel: 20` / `minLevel: 40` for evolution skills so players unlock them as they evolve.
- **Learned skills** appear in combat slots automatically (like the old starting skills). You can pick up to `maxLoadout` of them to actually carry into battle via the loadout strip at the bottom of the tree panel.
- **Adding skills:** add the skill to the `skills` array first (so the tooltip, effects, and combat know it), then push a node onto `global` or the matching lineage with its `prereq`/`minLevel`. Restart and it appears on the map.

### Combos (element interplay)

`combos` in `content.js` is a table of **effect pairs** that make matching skills hit harder. When a target already carries one status/effect and is then hit by a skill that reacts to it, the damage is multiplied:

```js
combos: [
  { target: "wet",       skill: "lightning", mult: 1.5 },  // lightning vs wet → 150%
  { target: "wet",       skill: "frost",     mult: 1.4 },  // frost vs wet → deep freeze
  { target: "frozen",    skill: "physical",  mult: 1.6 },  // frozen + physical → shatter
  { target: "burning",   skill: "fire",      mult: 1.6 },  // burning + fire → bigger burn
  { target: "expose",    skill: "physical",  mult: 1.35 }, // broken guard
  { target: "weaken",    skill: "physical",  mult: 1.2 },  // overwhelmed
  // add your own pairs here...
]
```

- `target` — the status the enemy must already have (from a skill's `effect`), e.g. `wet`, `frozen`, `burning`, `expose`, `weaken`.
- `skill` — the element (or effect tag) of the incoming hit that reacts, e.g. `lightning`, `frost`, `fire`, `physical`.
- `mult` — damage multiplier when both conditions are true.
- Skill definitions optionally carry `bonusTags: ["wet"]` so a single effect can trigger combos even if its `effect` name differs. The client shows the currently-relevant combo hints ("lightning strikes harder vs wet") as pills in the Skill Tree panel — they stay in sync with `combos` automatically.

Example: put a `wet`-applying effect on a skill (e.g. `effect: "wet"`), and every lightning/lightning-affected skill hitting that enemy uses ×1.5. Remove a combo row to disable it — combat and the hints follow automatically, no JS changes.

## Monsters

The roster is **30 monsters**, each with an `id`, `name`, `hp`, `attack`, `speed`, `image`, and a `rarity` (`common` → `mythic`). Optional `element` sets the damage type of its attacks (see Skills section) — otherwise it defaults to `physical`. Dungeon waves pull monster ids from each dungeon's `monsterPool`; bigger dungeons scale a monster's HP and attack up (see below).

**Rarity drives loot:** a monster's `rarity` sets how likely it is to drop a loot item at all (see the Loot section). Common monsters barely drop anything; rare ones drop more often. Golem is `rare` and appears even in the F-rank pool so you can find its **Heart of Golem** early.

Examples: common (slime, goblin, giant_rat, …), uncommon (skeleton, orc, griffin, …), rare (golem, stone_warden, wraith, …), epic+ (wyvern, lich, hydra, ancient_golem).

## Dungeon sizes

`dungeonSizes` in `content.js` — Small / Normal / Big / Huge. Each has:

- `stamina` — stamina each party member pays to start a delve of this size (currently **3 for every size** — flat cost, change any row to change it)
- `count` — wave-size multiplier for ranks with `sizeProfile: "more"` (bigger = more monsters)
- `fewerCount` — wave-size multiplier for ranks with `sizeProfile: "fewerStronger"` (bigger = **fewer** monsters)
- `power` — monster HP/attack multiplier for this size
- `goldScale` / `woodScale` / `xpScale` — reward multipliers

## Dungeons: rewards and waves

Each row in `dungeons` controls its own fight:

- `goldBase` / `woodBase` — base reward for a Normal-size delve (× size `goldScale`/`woodScale`, split among the party)
- `xpReward` — base XP per delve (× size `xpScale`, split among the party)
- `monsterPool` — list of monster ids that may appear in the wave
- `monsterCount` — base number of foes; scaled by the size `count`/`fewerCount`
- `monsterPower` — HP/attack multiplier that grows with rank (SS+ hits much harder)
- `sizeProfile` — `"more"` for F–A (bigger = more monsters) or `"fewerStronger"` for S/SS/SS+ (bigger = fewer but stronger foes)

Example: `SS+` `huge` uses `monsterCount 5 × fewerCount 0.5 = ~3` monsters, each with `monsterPower 5.5 × size.power 1.3 ≈ 7×` base HP/attack — few, terrifying foes.

## Combat tuning

`combat` in `content.js`:

- `damageVariance` — ±random spread on every damage roll (`0.2` = ±20%)
- `resistanceMitigation` — each point of a player's `resistance` reduces incoming monster damage (`0.25` means 25% of resistance is subtracted)
- `manaRegenPerRound` — **base** mana restored to each party member after every round. The real per-player value is this base **plus** class `manaRegen` plus item `stats.manaRegen` plus any `manaRegenBonus` trait (see the Mana section). Default `3`.
- `monsterAttackDelayMs` — pause between **each monster's** attack when the monsters take their turn (default `900`). Monsters now act **one by one** with the HP bars ticking down between attacks, instead of all at once.
- `turnTimeoutMs` — **server** safety timeout (ms). If the active player stalls (client died), the server auto-ends their turn after this. The **client** shows a 10-second bar during your turn; keep this server value above 10,000 so it only catches real stalls.
- `critChance` — chance any hit (player or monster) lands a critical hit (default `0.12` = 12%). Set to `0` to disable crits.
- `critMult` — damage multiplier on a critical hit (default `1.6`). Crits flash a bigger "CRIT!" number, play a crunch, and shake the whole combat view.
- `monsterScale` — global multiplier on monster HP **and** attack (default `5.0`, so monsters are 5× base strength). Applied on top of the dungeon rank/size `power`. Set to `1` for the original difficulty, or `2.5` for the pre-2× tune.

Combat is **turn-based**: the fastest living member acts first, then the rest in speed order. A player may act multiple times per turn (attack, skill, or eat — each one resets their turn bar). When every living player has ended their turn, the monsters act **one at a time** (each attack broadcasts its own hit, `monsterAttackDelayMs` apart), then the round counter ticks up and everyone regains mana for the next round. Downed players are skipped automatically.

## Food

- `food: { healBase, healPct }` in `content.js` — each food eaten in battle heals `round(healBase + healPct × maxHp)`. Default `10` and `0.02`: 10 food ≈ 100 + 20% of max HP.
- Food comes from **Search** (an outcome with `food`) and the **Tavern Provisions** (`town.tavern.provisions`).
- Eating is a combat action on your turn and resets your turn bar.

## Shop items, equipment, and rarities

Every item in the `items` array carries a `rarity` (`common` | `uncommon` | `rare` | `epic` | `legendary` | `mythic` | `ancient_relic`). The color comes from `loot.rarityMeta`. Each item:

```js
{
  id: "leather_helm",
  name: "Leather Helm",
  slot: "head",                       // weapon | head | armor | legs | boots | amulet | ring | consumable | material
  rarity: "common",
  price: { gold: 35, wood: 8 },
  stats: { maxHp: 30, resistance: 4 }, // gear only: attack | maxHp | resistance | mana | magicPower | speed | manaRegen
  heal: 40,                            // consumable only — HP restored when used in combat
  food: 2,                             // consumable only — food granted (bought straight to your food pouch)
  image: "/images/items/leather_helm.png",
  description: "+30 HP, +4 Res",
}
```

**The Blacksmith only sells `common`/`uncommon`/`rare` items** (set `loot.buyable` to change this). Epic, legendary, mythic, and ancient-relic gear is **loot-only** — it only drops from dungeon monsters, never appears in the shop.

- `slot: "material"` items (essences, `golem_heart`, `ancient_relic`) are **crafting/temple materials** — they can drop as loot but can't be equipped and aren't sold by the Blacksmith.
- There are **16 class weapons** (2 per class, e.g. `battle_axe`/`war_hammer` for the Warrior). Any class can equip any weapon; the stat bonuses just feed your `attack`/`magicPower` etc., so they naturally suit the classes whose stats they boost.
- `stats.manaRegen` on an item (e.g. the rare `mana_talisman` amulet) adds to the wearer's per-round mana regen.

Gear you buy goes into your **inventory**; equip it in the Inventory screen. There are **8 equipment slots**: `weapon`, `head`, `armor`, `legs`, `boots`, `amulet`, `ring1`, `ring2` (the labels shown are in `equipmentSlots`). A `slot: "ring"` item can fill either ring1 or ring2. Equipped stats are added to your character and shown on your profile card.

To add an item: push a row onto `items` and drop art in `public/images/items/`. If its rarity is buyable it appears in the shop automatically.

## Victory and defeat

- **Victory** (all monsters dead): gold/wood/XP awarded as above; anyone still at 0 HP loses 1 life and is revived to full.
- **Defeat** (whole party down): every party member loses 1 life and returns to town at full HP.
- `starting.lives` sets how many lives you begin with (default 3 hearts). The only way to restore a lost heart is the Ancient Temple's **Mend Heart** (needs a Heart of Golem).

## Mana

At the **start of every delve** each party member is restored to full HP **and full mana** (`spawnWave`). After each round every living member regains `manaRegen` mana, capped at their max.

A player's `manaRegen` is: **`combat.manaRegenPerRound` (base 3) + class `manaRegen` bonus + item `stats.manaRegen` + any `manaRegenBonus` trait**. Examples:

- `mage` has `manaRegen: 2` on its class object (→ 5 at level 1).
- The rare `mana_talisman` amulet grants `stats: { mana: 20, manaRegen: 1 }`.
- An anomaly trait with `effect: { type: "manaRegenBonus", amount: 1 }` adds 1.
- Evolved classes set a higher `manaRegen` (Archmage 3, Archon 4, High Priest 2, Divine Saint 3) and the difference is applied when you evolve.

Skills can **restore** mana with `manaRestore` (flat) and/or `manaRestorePct` (fraction of max mana). Set `target: "party"` and the heal/mana restore applies to **every living member** (e.g. `spirit_surge`, `resurgence`).

## Loot drops

When a dungeon is won, each **dead monster** independently rolls a drop:

1. Its `rarity` sets the gate: `loot.dropChance[monster.rarity]` is the chance it drops anything (common 20%, ancient relic 75%).
2. If it drops, the dungeon's **grade** (`dungeons[].rank`) picks the item rarity from `loot.gradeWeights` — F is weighted heavily to common; S/SS/SS+ can roll epic/legendary/mythic and even `ancient_relic`.
3. The item is chosen at random from `items` of that rarity (excluding `consumable`), and goes to a random living member's inventory. The result is announced in the victory text and town log.

Tunables, all in `content.js` → `loot`:
- `buyable` — rarities the Blacksmith sells (`["common","uncommon","rare"]`). Everything above is loot-only.
- `rarityOrder` / `rarityMeta` — the seven rarities and their label/color.
- `dropChance` — per-monster-rarity drop odds.
- `gradeWeights` — per dungeon rank, the rarity **weights** for the rolled item. Bigger/more-dangerous ranks skew higher. Set a weight to `0` to forbid a rarity in that rank.

To make a monster drop more: raise its `rarity` (in the `monsters` array) or raise `dropChance` for that rarity. To make a rank drop better gear: raise the epic/legendary/mythic weights in its `gradeWeights` row.

## The Ancient Temple

A town location (action card + overlay) offering three rites, each costing `town.temple.stamina` (default 2):

- **Evolve** — requires level 20+ (or 40+ for the second evolution) and an **Ancient Relic** (`ancient_relic`, loot-only, `slot: "material"`). Consumes the relic, changes your class to the evolved form, applies its `evolveBonus` stats, and fully heals you. The evolved class's signature skill is **not** granted for free anymore — it is learned on the **Skill Tree** (see the Skill Tree section).
- **Mend a Heart** — requires a **Heart of Golem** (`golem_heart`, a rare drop — the golem monster appears even in F-rank). Restores one of your `starting.lives` hearts.
- **Craft** — combines materials into gear. Each `temple.recipes` entry lists `inputs` (item + qty), a `cost` (gold/wood), and an `output`. Example: `stone_ash_sword + fire_essence → fire_ash_sword`.

Recipe inputs are the `slot: "material"` items (fire/frost/arcane/shadow essences, `heart_of_fire`, etc.). Outputs are real equippable weapons.

## Class evolution (level 20 and 40)

Every class has **two evolutions**: a stronger mid form at **level 20**, and the **strongest apex form at level 40**. The Ancient Temple performs the transformation (requires the matching level and an Ancient Relic).

Each class object that can evolve carries:

```js
evolution: { level: 20, to: "warlord" },   // base class → mid form at 20
```

and the evolved class carries its own:

```js
{
  slug: "warlord",
  label: "War Lord",
  baseClass: "warrior",                    // marks it as an evolution — hidden from the setup screen
  evolution: { level: 40, to: "war_emperor" }, // mid → apex at 40
  startingSkills: ["war_cry"],             // the evolution skill, granted on evolve
  growth: { hp: 22, attack: 5, mana: 2, resistance: 4, magicPower: 1 }, // per-level after evolving
  evolveBonus: { hp: 60, attack: 8, mana: 10, resistance: 6, magicPower: 3 }, // one-time on evolve
  ...
}
```

Chain: **base @20 → mid → mid @40 → apex**. The apex class has `baseClass` but **no** `evolution` (it's the strongest form). Evolved classes never appear on the character-creation screen, but the temple shows the current class's next form with its level requirement, the signature skill you can then learn on the Skill Tree, and the stat bonus.

When you evolve:
- The **Ancient Relic is consumed** and the temple stamina is spent.
- Your `character` becomes the evolved class (with its new `growth` / `manaRegen`).
- `evolveBonus` stats are applied **once**, and `manaRegen` adjusts by the class's `manaRegen` difference.
- You're healed to full HP and mana.

The evolution **skill is no longer auto-added** — class skills (including the evolution signature skills) are acquired through the **Skill Tree** after you meet the level requirement.

Stat notes: evolved classes still list `hp`/`attack`/… ranges, but those are **reference only** — stats are accumulative (rolled once at creation, then `growth` each level), so evolution just adds `evolveBonus` and switches future `growth` to the new class.

## Story intro and day overlay

The `story` block in `content.js` powers the intro screen shown when a game starts:

```js
story: {
  title: "The Setra Game",
  paragraphs: ["…", "…", "…"],
  cta: "Set Forth",
}
```

The `cta` is the button text. When the day changes, a "Day N" overlay appears (you slept through the night, stamina restored). Search, Rest, and Sleep still show their own toasts.

## Images (color placeholders → real art)

Class portraits, monsters, and dungeons render as **colored circles/tiles** (set in `public/style.css` under `.portrait--*`). Drop a PNG/JPG at the path listed in `content.js` and it **automatically replaces the color** — no code change needed.

`images.backgrounds.menu`, `.setup`, `.lobby`, `.town`, `.dungeon`, `.tavern` are reserved for future background art; the UI uses warm parchment gradients for now. `images.ui.panel` is an optional texture for the gold-bordered container.

Suggested folders:

- `public/images/backgrounds/`
- `public/images/ui/`
- `public/images/characters/`
- `public/images/monsters/`

- `public/images/items/`
- `public/images/skills/`

Set the matching path in `content.js`. PNG or JPG both work.

## Music

Drop audio files (`.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.flac`) into `public/music/`. The widget in the corner plays them **in filename order, looping back** to the first when the list ends, with a Volume slider and Play/Pause. No audio folder or no files = no widget shown.

## Sound effects and action feedback

Damage/heal/block **pop-ups**, **hit effects** on monsters, and **sound effects** play automatically on every action — no content config needed.

- The **♪ sound button** (top-right of the screen) toggles all sound effects. Your choice is remembered between sessions.
- The **☰ Menu button** (top-left of the screen) leaves the current game and returns to the main menu, so you can start over or pick a different mode.
- Tavern wins/losses and Search results now stay on screen so you can read what happened before they close.
- **Rest** shows a "💤 You slept" toast, and when everyone rests the new day shows a "🌅 Day N dawns" toast.
- Combat hit effects are colored and animated by **damage type** (see `element` under Skills): physical slashes shake sideways, arcane wobbles, holy pulses, shadow jitters — and critical hits shake the whole battle view.

## Effects & sounds (how hits look and sound)

Every combat hit now picks a **recipe** from the `effects` map in `content.js`. The server tags each hit with an effect name, and the client looks up the recipe to animate it. You can add/change/remove effects just by editing `content.js` — no JS changes.

Each recipe has 4 fields:

- `animation` — which shake/wobble the target gets: `hit`, `hit-arcane`, `hit-holy`, `hit-shadow`, `hit-crit`, `heal`, `defend`. (These map to existing CSS classes.)
- `color` — color of the damage number and particles (any CSS color).
- `particles` — a visual burst type: `slash` (diagonal arc), `shatter` (shards fly out), `burst` (radial burst), `orb` (rising sphere), `rays` (golden rays), `pulse` (dark shockwave), `glow` (soft halo), `ring` (expanding ring), `fire`, `frost`.
- `sound` — a filename (without `.mp3`) **or a list** to pick from randomly. Missing files fall back to a synthesized sound automatically.

Example — the sword-slash recipe:

```js
slash: { animation: "hit", color: "#ff7a5c", particles: "slash", sound: ["slash1", "slash2", "slash3", "slash4"] },
```

**Which effect a hit uses:** a skill's `effect` field overrides everything (e.g. `heavy_strike` has `effect: "heavy"`, `cleave` has `effect: "axe"`, the Tank's basic attack `shield_bash` has `effect: "crush"`). Skills without an `effect` tag fall back to their `element` (physical → `slash`, arcane → `arcane`, holy → `holy`, shadow → `shadow`). Monster attacks always use the `monster` recipe. Heals use `heal`, defends use `defend`, crits use `crit`. Crits always shake the whole combat view.

**Adding a new effect:** push a new key onto `effects` (e.g. `lightning: { animation: "hit-arcane", color: "#ffe14d", particles: "burst", sound: ["lightning"] }`), then tag a skill with `effect: "lightning"` (or give it an `element` that maps to it). Restart and it works.

### Where to find sounds

Free, legal sound packs (CC0 / free license — no attribution worries):

- **Kenney.nl** — `impactSounds.rar` and `digitalAudio.rar` are perfect for hits/magic. Drop the files you like into `public/sounds/`.
- **freesound.org** — search "sword slash", "magic spell", "hit". Check each file's license.
- **OpenGameArt.org** — sound effects section, mostly CC0.
- **Pixabay.com** and **Mixkit.co** — free sound effects, no account needed for most.

Name files descriptively — `slash1.mp3`, `slash2.mp3`, `heavy1.mp3`, `firemagic.mp3` — and reference them (without the extension) in an effect's `sound`. Avoid `#`, spaces, or odd characters in filenames (they break URLs). The page lists everything in `public/sounds/` on load; missing files just fall back to a synthesized sound.

## What not to edit for content

You do not need to change `server/` or `public/js/` to add a class, item, or image. Restart after `content.js` changes.
